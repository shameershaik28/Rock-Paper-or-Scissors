Rock, Paper, Scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic two-player game where each player simultaneously chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The outcomes are determined by comparing the chosen items, with the following rules:

Rock destroys scissors.
Scissors cut paper.
Paper covers rock.
If both players choose the same item, the game ends in a draw.
This project implements a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python, allowing a user to play against the computer. The game is broken down into four main parts:

Get the User’s Choice: Prompt the user to enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
Get the Computer’s Choice: Randomly generate the computer’s choice.
Compare the Choices and Determine a Winner: Compare the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the outcome.
Display the Results: Start the program and show the results of the game to the user.
